# Tandemloop Screening Test

This repo has my solutions for the 4 problems in the Tandemloop screening test.  
I have done the test in JavaScript (Node.js) and added small test files using Jest.

## Coding Language
JavaScript (Node.js)  
Comments are added inside each file.

## Files

Problem-1.js  -> calculator class with add, sub, mul, div  
Problem-2.js  -> print odd numbers till given number  
Problem-3.js  -> odd number series with special even-stop condition  
Problem-4.js  -> count multiples in array (1 to 9)  
__tests__/    -> test files for each problem
